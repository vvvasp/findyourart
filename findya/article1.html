        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph1">You are probably reading it because you need to do something ‘creative’ in your life. Maybe it is a school project, maybe you have written in your CV that you are ‘young, eager to learn and very creative’ and now you have a problem because it was just a few random words that every employer wants to read, wasn’t it? Firstly, just sit down, close your eyes and breath. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. Well done!</p>
        <p class="article_important" id="article_important1">Open your eyes and open your mind.</p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph2"> Unlock this little room in your mind palace with your artistic self. Free those colours, texters, memories from your childhood when you were playing around, drawing what came to your mind without deciding whether it is worth drawing or not. Say ‘hello’ to your ‘inner child’.  </p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph3">Secondly, just watch the world how it is. Don’t assume that you know everything about things that surrender you. Probably you barely know the truth about them. Probably all you think you know is just an assumption. Soulless assumption. Is it bad? Not really. Knowing a true story of everyone and everything will be exhausting to the level of death. It is alright.</p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph4">However, try to understand things without judging them. Try to feel more, don’t start with creating opinion on whatever thing you can see. Admire creatures of this world. Admire scents of the wind. Admire sound of the waves when you are standing at the seashore. Admire new day, drawn yourself in the night’s atmosphere. Try it and your world view might change drastically.</p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph5">What’s wrong? You don’t want to? Do you think that it is just a stupid article on the Internet? Did you make an opinion about it by now? Did you try to understand? Do it. There’s nothing you can lose. if you do it, it will be all done. You will start catching a moment, seizing the day (‘Carpe diem’ as Horace once wrote), stealing the feelings and the atmosphere from daily, ordinary chores, places, activities. </p>
