        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph1">There’s in no need for a starting paragraph here. What you need to do is just follow along. Read and do it. Without an excuse. Just let yourself be a part of this flow. This artistic flow. Start preparation for a transition to the main fairy tale’s character right now. Don’t hesitate. Firstly, focus on the most heart-touching parts from the basic regular fairy tale. What’s the most important thing in them? What’s essential? What does seem achievable? </p>
            <p class="article_important" id="article_important1">Almost nothing. So what?</p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph2"> You don’t have a magic Godmother to appear in your life and bring you a new dress. You are not going to start living with 12 dwarfs, too. There’s no knight in your life and you are not the one either. So what? Is everything gone?</p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph3">As if you really were thinking that you will become Prince Eric or Cinderella. Don't be silly, darling. Don’t wait for a magic unexpected event in your life. Just don’t. It will never come, trust me. However, you can do something better. Something that will change your life for real. Something that will keep benefiting you until the end of your life. What can it be? Let’s go to the next paragraph!</p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph4">I tell you straight ahead – you should start learning about yourself. I’m not joking even if it seems like that. Knowing yourself, being able to name your feelings is something that you should work at NOW. Understanding yourself or even only trying to do so is sometimes a good start of your artistic journey. As Picasso once said, ‘Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life’, what can be interpreted as ‘If you make art, you surely live in some kind of a unrealistic dream’. </p>
        <p class="artice_text" id="article_paragraph5">Does it sound familiar? Something like living as a main fairy tale’s character? It does. Because creating your own art is like your own fairy tale that you have to tell others about. It doesn’t matter whether you will use words, acrylic paints or Photoshop. What matters is your story. What matters is you.</p>
